# 📌 Problem Statement

**Title**:  
**AI-powered Smart Expense Tracker and Budget Planner**

---

**Background**:  
In today's fast-paced world, most individuals struggle to manage their finances efficiently. People often lose track of where they spend money, fail to categorize their expenses accurately, and find it difficult to stick to a planned budget. Manually tracking and categorizing expenses is tedious, error-prone, and unscalable. Furthermore, planning monthly savings based on past expenses remains a major challenge for most users.

**Problem**:  
- Users lack **real-time** visibility into their spending habits.
- Manual **expense entry and categorization** is time-consuming.
- Users cannot **predict future budgets** or expected savings easily.
- There is no **smart suggestion** or analysis to help users improve financial discipline.
- Scanning and uploading physical receipts into apps is cumbersome without automation.
- Existing apps often miss **personalized insights** powered by AI.

We propose building a **Full Stack AI-powered Expense Tracker and Budget Planner** that solves all the above problems smartly using **MERN stack**, **AI**, **NLP**, and **OCR technologies**.

---

**Key Features**:

✅ **Real-time Expense Management**:  
- Users can add, view, edit, and delete expenses easily.
- Expenses are automatically categorized (e.g., Food, Travel, Shopping) using AI-powered **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

✅ **Smart Budget Prediction**:  
- The app predicts **monthly savings** based on historical spending patterns using lightweight machine learning models.

✅ **OCR-based Receipt Scanning**:  
- Users can scan paper receipts using their mobile camera or upload images.

✅ **Financial Dashboard**:  
- Beautiful interactive charts (via **Recharts** or **Chart.js**) show:
  - Spending trends (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Category-wise spending distribution
  - Predicted vs. actual savings

✅ **Authentication and User Management**:  
- Secure **login/signup** using JWT tokens.
- Each user sees only their own expense data.

✅ **Performance Optimization**:  
- **Redis** caching for faster dashboard load times.
- **MongoDB** optimized queries and indexes.

✅ **Optional Future Scalability**:  
- Integrate Kafka/message queues for event-driven microservices if needed later.
